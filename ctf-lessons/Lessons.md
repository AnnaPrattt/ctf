### CTF Lessons

I used to teach CTF skills to other students in the [BYU Cybersecurity Student Association](https://github.com/BYU-CSA). Here are some copies of the lessons I taught. Not all lessons I taught are included in this repository; some of lessons taught were copies of lessons created by others the year prior.
