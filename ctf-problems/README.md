This repository contains some of the CTF problems I have made, most commonly for the university-wide CTFs that my university cybersecurity association organizes.

Not all of the CTF challenges I've ever created are included in this repository; during my early days as a cybersecurity student I rarely saved my extracurricular projects for future archival.
